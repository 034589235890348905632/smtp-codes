## Contribute

Ran into an SMTP code that wasn't very helpful and you figured out what it means? or maybe you work for an email provicer and want to contribute the codes your service returns so you can decrease your support volume? We'd love to help you document them! 

If you plan on making additions or edits to existing SMTP responses, you’ll need to fork the repo and [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request). All of the data is stored as JSON in the [/data](https://github.com/fm/smtp-codes/tree/main/data) folder. There's no need to set up the development environment for changes like this.

If the provider doesn't exist, add it to `providers.json` first. Also, feel free to add yourself to `contributors.json` to show up in the Contributors page!

Feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/fm/smtp-codes/issues/new) if you don’t feel like dealing with code. If you do not have a GitHub account, you can also submit them via email at [submit@smtp.codes](mailto:submit@smtp.codes?subject=New%20code%20submission&body=Full%20SMTP%20response%3A%0AEmail%20provider%2Fserver%20returning%20the%20code%3A%0AAny%20other%20details%3A)
